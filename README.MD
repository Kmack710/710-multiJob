## Add this to your Database! Without this it wont work! Be sure to change payment amount below to the amount of your unemployeed Paycheque 
```sql
ALTER TABLE `players`
	ADD COLUMN `job_two` TEXT NULL DEFAULT '{"name":"unemployed","onduty":true,"payment":10,"label":"Civilian","grade":{"name":"Freelancer","level":0},"isboss":false}';
```

## Dependancies 
- QBCore 
- Qb-menu or Renzucontextmenu 

## Flek's Updates:
### v1.0.1:
- Added a callback to grab the label of job_two allowing you to put that on the menu
- Added support for old qbcore
